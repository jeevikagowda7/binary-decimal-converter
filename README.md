# Binary to Decimal Converter (MATLAB)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project converts a binary number entered by the user into its decimal equivalent using positional weight logic.

## 🧠 Concept Used
Each binary digit is multiplied by 2 raised to its positional power and then summed to obtain the decimal value.

Example:
Binary: 1011
Decimal: 11

## 🚀 How It Works
- Accepts binary input as a string
- Iterates through each bit
- Applies 2^power logic
- Displays decimal output

## 🛠 Tools Used
- MATLAB
